# -Supervised-Learning-Classification-Model-GOT-Character-Predictions

Using information from the famous Game of Thrones book series, we created a predictive model of the binary response variables (whether the character is alive or not). Analysis includes feature engineering, model preparation, variable selection, model development, and model hyperparameter adjustment.

The developed classification model is:

-Logistic Regression
-K-Nearest Neighbors Classification (KNN)
-Classification Trees
-Random Forest (Classification)
-Gradient Boosted Models (GBM)

 Below Step for run the all code go 
 1. Read file from excel file GOT_character_predictions.xlsx .
 2. doc file birthweight_data_dictionary.pdf ( information about all features).
 3. Jupiter note required to run the code.
 4.python file - Kernel-> Restart & RunAll.
 
 The final output of the Jupyter notebook is a table of  candidate models showing model type, training  and test accuracy, AUC score, confusion matrix, and  final model selection.
